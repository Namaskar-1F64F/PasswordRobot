Hey thanks for stopping by!
This bot does a very useful job by reminding everyone to practice safe password security. I'll tell you if your password is compromised or not, and if not, it's compromised now! You will need to create a telegram bot, get a mongdb database with a 'Interface' database with a 'Connection'  collection, and fill in these environment variables:

```
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING
PASSWORD_TELEGRAM_TOKEN
```

### Running
```
yarn
yarn start
```
